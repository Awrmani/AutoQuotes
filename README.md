## Demo Deployment URLs

| Interface      | Url                                                                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| End-user       | http://sixix.denke.hu                                                   |
| Mechanic shop  | http://shop.sixix.denke.hu                                              |
| Third-party UI | http://thirdp.sixix.denke.hu/suppliers/firstSupplie/quotes/customQuote1 |

## Seed file containing credentials for demo users

!! Users are only re-seeded on a deploy with a new seed version, so if you get locked out please reach out to us so we can re-seed the DB

- [Shop](packages/back-end/src/fixtures/shopUserSeed.json)
- [End-user](packages/back-end/src/fixtures/endUserSeed.json)

### Notes:

- Passwords are hashed in the system you can only see them in cleartext form in the seed file
- Third-party suppliers do not have users, they are authenticated by the `magic link` they get in the email
- To test that functionality:
  - You can set the supplier's email address in the `Shop UI` with an admin user
  - Get a custom quote with an end-user
  - Follow the link in the email
